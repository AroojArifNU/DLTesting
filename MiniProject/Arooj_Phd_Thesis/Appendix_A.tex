\section{Detail of Appendices}
This section presents the code of the thesis entitled "Conditional Anonymity enabled Blockchain-based Ad Dissemination in Vehicular Ad-hoc Network".
This code is developed by {\href{https://sites.google.com/view/abidjamal/home?authuser=2}{\textbf{Abid Jamal}}} under the supervision of {\href{www.njavaid.com}{\textbf{Dr. Nadeem Javaid}}} for the fulfilment of MS thesis presented to the Department of Computer Science, {\href{https://www.comsats.edu.pk/}{COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI)}} in Spring 2021. The present work is completed using the resources of ComSens (Communication over Sensors) Research Lab. In this section, we also provide the guidelines how to run the code in the \textit{readme.txt} file. Furthermore, if you have any query, please contact:\par

\textit{Readme:}\par
  Before implementing the source code in Python, please read the notes given below.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item As an initial step, must read the original algorithms before going for code implementation.
  \item Understand the code step by step with the help of the mentioned comments.
  \item For problem 1, put the mtree.py in the same folder as the main.py file.
  \item Copy the code provided in the following appendices and paste in the .py file.
  \item Install all of the required Python Packages.
  \item Save the Python file with an appropriate file name with .py extension and execute.
\end{enumerate}
