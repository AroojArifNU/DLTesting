This thesis uses terms such AI system, deep learning models, system or DNNs, interchangeably in this document. Terms related to classes in dataset (supervised learning case) such as component or class, are also used interchangeably.

\textbf{Important reading notes:}

     Terms that are used but not defined/explained in the text are listed and defined in the \textbf{GLOSSARY}. They are displayed in \textsc{small caps} in the text. Clicking on a word shown in \textsc{small caps} (e.g., \textsc{Local coverage}) takes the reader directly to the definition of that term in the Glossary. From there, one may click on the page number shown at the end of the definition to return.
